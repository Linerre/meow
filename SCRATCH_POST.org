** INTRODUCTION
‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö ---------------------------------------------------------------- ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö

Welcome to Meow! Meow is a modal-editing package for Emacs, inspired by Kakoune.
This is a hands-on tutorial. It aims to help both new and experienced Emacs
users get started with or migrate to Meow as easily as possible.

In the first section, you will learn about the basics of movement and editing.
This will give you a feel for Meow.

In the second section, you will learn more advanced functionalities such as
'expand' and 'inner-of', which will enable you to move further and faster. The
selection of text will also become more accurate and flexible.

** BASICS
‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö --------------------------- SECTION 1 --------------------------- ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö

                    üêæ MODES

                    In "modal editing", users interact with the text through
       .---,        modes. There are *five* modes in Meow and the most used two
       ‚îÇ i ‚îÇ        are *NORMAL* and *INSERT*. If you set up Meow properly, at
       `---'        the bottom left you should see NORMAL, indicating you are
                    now in normal mode. Make sure Caps Lock is OFF and press
                    ~i~. The indicator turns to INSERT and you are able to type
       .---,        in characters as usual. This is insert mode. Press ~ESC~ or
       ‚îÇESC‚îÇ        ~C-[~ to leave it and return to normal mode. The other
       `---'        three modes are *MOTION*, *KEYPAD*, and *BEACON*. These
                    modes will be explained in the third part.


                    üêæ MOVEMENT

                    The movement in a buffer (representations of the content
       .---,        of a file opened in Emacs) can be done using the arrow keys.
       ‚îÇ ‚Üë ‚îÇ        When pressed, the cursor will move one column/row in the
   .---'---'---,    the corresponding direction. Hold any of ~‚Üê~, ~‚Üë~, ~‚Üí~, ~‚Üì~
   ‚îÇ ‚Üê ‚îÇ ‚Üì ‚îÇ ‚Üí ‚îÇ    to continue the movement until the place where you want
   `---'---'---`    to stop.

                    However, furthering the tradition of mode-based editors,
 .---,---,---,---,  the ~h~, ~j~, ~k~, ~l~ keys are often used for the same
 ‚îÇ h ‚îÇ j ‚îÇ k ‚îÇ l ‚îÇ  purpose, and will respectively move the cursor to the
 `---'---'---'---`  left, down, up, right by one, when hit. Using those keys
   ‚Üï   ‚Üï   ‚Üï   ‚Üï    is the recommended way of moving around in a buffer.
 .---,---,---,---,  If you're not familiar with this concept, the proximity
 ‚îÇ ‚Üê ‚îÇ ‚Üì ‚îÇ ‚Üë ‚îÇ ‚Üí ‚îÇ  of those four keys with the rest of the lettered keys
 `---'---'---'---`  on a ~qwerty~ layout allows faster interaction with the
                    cursor position than if the user had to move their hand to
                    reach the arrow keys.

                    üêæ SELECTION -- SINGLE WORD

                    But this is still tedious. Meow offers more when it comes to
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíword‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        moving the cursor. Press ~e~, you will see a /word/ has been
    ‚á°               selected and the cursor moves to its end. Press ~e~ again to
 at word start      move further and select more[*]. ~b~ key does the same, but
                    in the opposite direction.

 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ê£word‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí       One or more extra blank spaces might be included in the
    ‚á°               selection if the cursor is before/after the word start/end.
 before the word    In the left illustrations, symbol ‚ñí denotes the text around
 after the word     the target /word/. ‚á° and ‚á£ indicate where the cursor was
         ‚á£          before the movement, while ‚ñãshows the cursor position (and
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñãword‚ê£‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí       shape) after the movement.

                    It's therefore important to know this key idea behind Meow:
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíword‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        *Movement means selection*. One advantage of this behavior
    ‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£            is that users immediately get two useful positions each time
 move forward       they move (and select): the start and end of a selection.
                    When moving forwards word-wise, the cursor will stop right
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñãword‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        after the word's last character. On the contrary, moving
     ‚Ü¢‚Ü¢‚Ü¢‚Ü¢           backwards one word will place the cursor right before the
 move backward      first letter.

                    üêæ SELECTION -- WORD CLUSTER

                     Suppose you want to select a chunk of words instead of a
   .---, .---,       single one, you can extend the word-level selection with
   ‚îÇ e ‚îÇ+‚îÇ0-9‚îÇ       ~meow-expand-N~, where ~N~ is a digit of 0-9. You may have
   `---' `---'       already noticed in the previous section that when you hit
~meow-expand-[0-9]~  ~e~ or ~b~ to move and select, there are digits (0-9)
                     blinking at the end of the words ahead of the current
                     selection (or behind, if you select backward). Take the
                     below sentence as an example:

                     ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíWith Meow comes the power of modal editing.‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí
                                         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ to select ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

                     To select the last five words, first move the cursor to "t"
                     of "the" and then type ~e~. You will see some digits
                     show up and soon disappear:

                     ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíWith Meow comes the powe1 o2 moda3 editin4.‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí
                                        ‚Ü±‚îî‚îÄ‚îò     ‚á°  ‚á°     ‚á°       ‚á°
                                   selected
                                             ‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£ select forward ‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£

                     All but the selected words have their last letter replaced
      .---,          with a digit. If you feel the digit's showing-up time is
      ‚îÇ g ‚îÇ          too short, you may want to add the following line to your
      `---'          init.el:
  ~meow-cancel~
                              ~(set meow-expand-hint-remove-delay 1.5)~
                     To cancel the current selection, press the key ~g~.


                    üêæ SELECTION -- LINE

                    Wanna select more? Great! Let's select lines this time. In
      .---,         normal mode, type ~x~. The current line will be selected.
      ‚îÇ x ‚îÇ         Press ~x~ again, you will select yet another line! You can
      `---'         keep doing this until you include all the lines you want.
   ~meow-line~

                    Now, cancel the selection with ~g~. It's worth knowing that
                    ~meow-expand-x~ will automatically function at line-level
                    when you select lines. Suppose you have the first line
                    selected in the text below:

                    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ selected ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
                    The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
                    1t isn‚Äôt just one of your holiday games;
                    2ou may think at first I‚Äôm as mad as a hatter
                    3hen I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.

      .---,         Hit 3 and the selection will expand to the beginning of the
      ‚îÇ ; ‚îÇ         3rd line, *without* selecting it. What's more, Meow is
      `---'         flexible enough to do this in a reversed manner. Type ~;~ to
   ~meow-reverse~   try it out yourself.

                    üêæ MAKING CHANGES

                    Now that you can move around and select stuff, it's time to
                    make changes to buffer content. There are five frequently
                    used keys for changing text in normal mode: ~c~, ~d~, ~p~,
                    ~s~, ~u~.

    .---,           To change a word, select the word first (~e~) and then press
    ‚îÇ c ‚îÇ           the key ~c~. You will find you are in insert mode. Of course,
    `---'           you can expand the selection and then change all of them.
 ~meow-change~      Similarly, to change a whole line, select it with ~x~ and
                    then change (~c~) it. Again, you can expand the selection
                    to include multiple lines and replace them with new text.

    .---,           To delete a single character, press the key ~d~. Note this
    ‚îÇ d ‚îÇ           command by default deletes forward, meaning it will delete
    `---'           the white space right in front of a selection. If there is
 ~meow-delete~      nothing selected, it removes the character under the current
                    cursor. The key ~D~, when pressed, will delete backward (~meow-backward-delete~).

    .---,           If you want to delete the selected object (word, phrase or
    ‚îÇ s ‚îÇ           line), press ~s~. Note, if there is no selection at all,
    `---'           pressing the key ~s~ will act as if you pressed ~C-k~ (kill
 ~meow-kill~        rest of current line or one or more lines).

    .---,           However, there are times when you want to just copy the
    ‚îÇ y ‚îÇ           selected text. In that case, press the key ~y~ after you
    `---'           select some text.
 ~meow-save~

    .---,           In Emacs, to kill means to cut, meaning you can yank (or
    ‚îÇ p ‚îÇ           paste) the killed text. To do so, press the key ~p~. If you
    `---'           killed an entire line, then ~p~ will yank it right above the
 ~meow-yank~        current line.

    .---,           If you later changed your mind and would like to undo the
    ‚îÇ u ‚îÇ           changes, press ~u~ a few times. *TODO*: explain ~U~?
    `---'           next: open-above and open-below
 ~meow-undo~
