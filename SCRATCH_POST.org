#+END_CENTER

‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö ---------------------------------------------------------------- ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö

Welcome to Meow! Meow is a modal-editing package for Emacs, inspired by Kakoune.
This is a hands-on tutorial. It aims to help both new and experienced Emacs
users get started with or migrate to Meow as easily as possible.

During the learning period, it is useful to activate an automatically displayed
contextual help for commands in normal mode: `:set -add global autoinfo normal`

In the first section, you will learn about the basics of movement and editing.
This will give you a feel for Meow.

In the second section, you will learn more advanced functionalities such as
'expand' and 'inner-of', which will enable you to move further and faster. The
selection of text will also become more accurate and flexible.

                    üêæ MODES
                    In "modal editing", users interact with the text through
       .---,        modes. There are *five* modes in Meow and the most used two
       | i |        are *NORMAL* and *INSERT*. If you set up Meow properly, at
       `---'        the bottom left you should see NORMAL, indicating you are
                    now in normal mode. Make sure Caps Lock is OFF and press
                    ~i~. The indicator turns to INSERT and you are able to type
       .---,        in characters as usual. This is insert mode. Press ~ESC~ or
       |esc|        ~C-[~ to leave it and return to normal mode. The other
       `---'        three modes are *MOTION*, *KEYPAD*, and *BEACON*. It is not
                    the focus of this tutorial and will be briefly explained in
                    a later section.


                    üêæ MOVEMENT
                    The movement in a buffer (representations of the content
       .---,        of a file opened in Emacs) can be done using the arrow keys.
       | ‚Üë |        When pressed, the cursor will move one column/row in the
   .---'---'---,    the corresponding direction. Hold the any of ~‚Üê~, ~‚Üë~, ~‚Üí~,
   | ‚Üê | ‚Üì | ‚Üí |    ~‚Üì~ to continue the movement until the place where you want
   `---'---'---`    to stop.

                    However, furthering the tradition of mode-based editors,
 .---,---,---,---,  the ~h~, ~j~, ~k~ and ~l~ keys are often used for the same
 | h | j | k | l |  purpose, and will respectively move the cursor to the
 `---'---'---'---`  left, down, up, right by one, when hit. Using those keys
   |   |   |   |    is the recommended way of moving around in a buffer.
 .---,---,---,---,  If you're not familiar with this concept, the proximity
 | ‚Üê | ‚Üì | ‚Üë | ‚Üí |  of those four keys with the rest of the lettered keys
 `---'---'---'---`  on a ~qwerty~ layout allows faster interaction with the
                    cursor position than if the user had to move their hand to
                    reach the arrow keys.

                    üêæ SELECTION -- SINGLE WORD
                    But this is still tedious. Meow offers more when it comes to
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíword‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        moving the cursor. Press ~e~, you will see a /word/ has been
    ‚á°               selected and the cursor moves to its end. Press ~e~ again to
 at word start      move further and select more[*]. ~b~ key does the same, but
                    in the opposite direction.

 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ê£word‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí       One or more extra blank spaces might be included in the
    ‚á°               selection if the cursor is before/after the word start/end.
 before the word    In the left illustrations, symbol ‚ñí denotes the text around
 after the word     the target /word/. ‚á° and ‚á£ indicates where the cursor was
         ‚á£          before the movement, while  ‚ñã shows the cursor position (and
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñãword‚ê£‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí       shape) after the movement.

                    It's therefore important to know this key idea behind Meow:
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíword‚ñã‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        *Movement means selection*. One advantage of this behavior
    ‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£‚Ü£            is that users immediately get two useful positions each time
 move forwards      they move (and select): the start and end of a selection.
                    Now let's try to take this advantage. Below is the first
 ‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñãword‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí        stanza of /The Naming of Cats/, and we will try to modify it
     ‚Ü¢‚Ü¢‚Ü¢‚Ü¢           at a few places.
 move backwards

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
    It isn‚Äôt just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I‚Äôm as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.

    -- T.S. Eliot
#+END_VERSE
First, move the cursor (~h,j,k,l~) at the character "d" of "difficult" and press
~e~. Now if you hit ~i~, you will enter insert mode. Type in "very" and a blank
space, then hit ~ESC~ to return to normal mode.

Move to "i" of "is" in the first line and select "is" using either ~e~ again, hit
~a~ and you will enter insert mode again, but this time the cursor stops at the
end of "is". Type a space and "indeed", then ~ESC~ the insert mode.

If you make word-level selection and then want to cancel it, type ~g~. Note,
moving the cursor with any of ~h,j,k,l~ also cancel this level of selection.
Hope this simple exercise gives you a feel for the basic movement in Meow.
Take a break and move on to the next section.

                    üêæ SELECTION -- WORD CLUSTER
Suppose you want to select a chunk of words instead of a single one, you can
extend the word-level selection with ~meow-expand~. You may have already noticed
in the previous section that when hitting ~e~ or ~b~ to move and select, there
are digits (0-9) blinking at the end of some words ahead of or behind the
current selection. Take the following sentence as an example.
#+BEGIN_CENTER
‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíWith Meow comes the power of modal editing.‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ to select ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
#+END_CENTER
To select the last five words, first move the cursor to "t" of "the". Then type
~e~, and you will see some digits showing up quickly and then disappearing:
#+BEGIN_CENTER
‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñíWith Meow comes the powe1 o2 moda3 editin4.‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí
                   ‚Ü±‚îî‚îÄ‚îò     ‚á°  ‚á°     ‚á°       ‚á°
               selected
#+END_CENTER
Note except for the selected "the", all the words following have their last
character replaced with a digit. If you feel the digit showing-up time is too
short, you may want to add ~(setq meow-expand-hint-remove-delay 1.5)~ to your
init.el. For now, just redo the selection and type any of 1, 2, 3, 4. Now you
have acquired the power of ~meow-expand-x~, where x is a digit in the range of
[0-9].

                    üêæ SELECTION -- LINE
Wanna select more? Great! Let's select lines this time. Below is the second
stanza from /The Naming of Cats/:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
First of all, there‚Äôs the name that the family use daily,
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey‚Äî
     All of them sensible everyday names.
     -- T.S. Eliot
#+END_VERSE
Move to any position in the first line, then type ~x~. Hooray! You've selected
the first line with Meow. Press ~x~ again, you will select yet another line! You
can keep doing this until all the lines you want are included.

Now cancel the selection with ~g~ and go back to the first line. It's worth
knowing that ~meow-expand-x~ will automatically extend to line-level when you
select lines. Suppose you have the first line selected.
#+BEGIN_CENTER
First of all, there‚Äôs the name that the family use daily,
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ selected ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
1     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
2uch as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey‚Äî
3     All of them sensible everyday names.
4     -- T.S. Eliot
#+END_CENTER
Hit 4 and it will save you from typing all the extra ~x~. What's more, Meow is
flexible enough to do this in a reversed manner. Move to the last line and
select it, type ~;~ (~meow-reverse~). BOOM! The order of these digits has been
reversed. Type 4 again and you will select back to the first line!

                    üêæ MAKING CHANGES
Now that you can move around and select stuff, let's start making changes to the
text. Here is the third stanza:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter‚Äî
     But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that‚Äôs particular,
     A name that‚Äôs peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum‚Äî
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.
     -- T.S. Eliot
#+END_VERSE
Select the "needs" on line 5 and type ~c~ (~meow-change~). The word got deleted
and you are now in insert mode. Type in "wants" and ~ESC~ to normal mode. Let's
say you don't like "Demeter" on line 3 and want to delete it. Move to "D" and
press ~e~, ~s~ (~meow-kill~). For Emacs user, to kill meas to cut. To yank
or paste the just-killed text, type ~p~ (~meow-yank~). If you ever changed your
mind and decided to discard the changes, hit ~u~ (~meow-undo~).

The above ~c, s, p, u~ operations work on the line level too. You may want to
experiment with them on your own.
